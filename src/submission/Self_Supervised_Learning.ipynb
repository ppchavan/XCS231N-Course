Is there a way we could ask machines to automatically learn a model which can generate good visual representations without a labeled dataset? Yes, enter self-supervised learning!\n",

        "Self-supervised learning (SSL) allows models to automatically learn a \"good\" representation space using the data in a given dataset without the need for their labels. Specifically, if our dataset were a bunch of images, then self-supervised learning allows a model to learn and generate a \"good\" representation vector for images.\n",

        "## What makes a \"good\" representation?\n",
        "A \"good\" representation vector needs to capture the important features of the image as it relates to the rest of the dataset. This means that images in the dataset representing semantically similar entities should have similar representation vectors, and different  images in the dataset should have different representation vectors. For example, two images of an apple should have similar representation vectors, while an image of an apple and an image of a banana should have different representation vectors.\n",

Contrastive learning aims to learn similar representations for similar images and different representations for different images. As we will see in this notebook, this simple idea allows us to train a surprisingly good model without using any labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, for each image in the dataset, SimCLR generates two differently augmented views of that image, called a **positive pair**. Then, the model is encouraged to generate similar representation vectors for this pair of images. See below for an illustration of the architecture (Figure 2 from the paper)."

Finally, a small neural network projection head $g$ maps the representation vectors to the space where the contrastive loss is applied. The goal of the contrastive loss is to maximize agreement between the final vectors **$z_i = g(h_i)$** and **$z_j = g(h_j)$**.
