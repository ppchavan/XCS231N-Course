{\bf Notebook Submission:}
Some questions in this assignment require notebook and Python code responses. For these questions, if you use Colab, you should run the \texttt{collect\_submission.ipynb} notebook to generate a zip file of your code. If you use a local or Azure platform, you should run the \texttt{collect\_submission.sh} script to generate a zip file of your code. When the zip file is generated, you should submit it to the Gradescope Coding submission for the corresponding assignment.
