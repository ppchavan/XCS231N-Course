\section{PyTorch on CIFAR-10}

For this part, you will be working with PyTorch, a popular and powerful deep learning framework.

Open up \textbf{PyTorch.ipynb}. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.
