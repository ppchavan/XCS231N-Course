\section{Goals}

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement \textbf{Batch Normalization} and \textbf{Layer Normalization} for training deep networks.
    \item Implement \textbf{Dropout} to regularize networks.
    \item Understand the architecture of \textbf{Convolutional Neural Networks} and get practice with training them.
    \item Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, \textbf{PyTorch}.
    \item Understand and implement RNN networks. Combine them with CNN networks for image captioning.
\end{itemize}
