\section{Goals}

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. 
The goals of this assignment are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
    \item Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
    \item Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
    \item Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
    \item Implement and apply a Softmax classifier.
    \item Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.
    \item Implement and apply a fully connected network classifier.
    \item Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
    \item Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
\end{itemize}


No GPU is required for this assignment.
