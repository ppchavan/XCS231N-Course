\section{Goals}

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement \textbf{Batch Normalization} and \textbf{Layer Normalization} for training deep networks.
    \item Implement \textbf{Dropout} to regularize networks.
    \item Understand the architecture of \textbf{Convolutional Neural Networks} and get practice with training them.
    \item Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, \textbf{PyTorch.ipynb}.
    \item Understand and implement RNN networks. Combine them with CNN networks for image captioning, \texttt{RNN\_Captioning\_pytorch.ipynb}.
\end{itemize}


For the following notebooks, you will need to use GPU runtime.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{PyTorch.ipynb}
    \item \texttt{RNN\_Captioning\_pytorch.ipynb}
\end{itemize}

For these notebooks, we expect light GPU usage. Please refer to the \texttt{README.md} file in the assignment directory for GPU environment setup.
