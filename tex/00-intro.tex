\section{Goals}

In this assignment, you will implement language networks and apply them to image captioning on the COCO dataset. Then you will be introduced to self-supervised learning to automatically learn the visual representations of an unlabeled dataset.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand and implement Transformer networks. Combine them with CNN networks for image captioning.
    \item Understand how to leverage self-supervised learning techniques to help with image classification tasks.
\end{itemize}
