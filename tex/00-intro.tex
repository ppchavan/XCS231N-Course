\section{Goals}

In this assignment, you will implement language networks and apply them to image captioning on the COCO dataset. Then you will be introduced to self-supervised learning to automatically learn the visual representations of an unlabeled dataset.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand and implement Transformer networks. Combine them with CNN networks for image captioning.
    \item Understand how to leverage self-supervised learning techniques to help with image classification tasks.
\end{itemize}

All notebooks require GPU. To save GPU usage time, we recommend you develop and debug your code without GPU first. Then you can run the code with GPU to get the final results.

Please refer to the \texttt{README.md} file in the assignment directory for GPU environment setup.
